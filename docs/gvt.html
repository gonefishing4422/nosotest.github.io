  <h4>Noso GVTs</h4>
  <p>Built into Noso protocol is a Governance Token (GVT) poll management system. This system allows GVT owners to create project related polls for consideration which are voted upon by other GVT owners. In order to participate in the voting process, an individual must acquire through purchase or trade, a Noso Governance Token (GVT). These tokens are available to anyone wanting to participate in the voting process.
Governance Tokens have the following specifications:
GVTs are transferable
1 GVT = 1 vote
All GVT owners can start polls
Polls with +75% of approbation will be mandatory; +50% will be recommended
New GVTs are minted every year only (on demand, after government poll approbation)
GVTs can be banned by other GVTs owners in certain circumstances.  When banned, the GVT owner becomes suspended from creating new polls or participating on existing ones for 90 days.
Each GVT can only run one poll at a time
GVTs rules itself can be adjusted by a GVT votation.
Example GVT poll:  Should NOSO reduce the PoW reward to 5%?
